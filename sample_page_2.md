## Car Price Prediction

**Project description:** In this project, the price of a car will be predicted based on a set of data from an online advertising portal. I will compare the effectiveness of predictive models.

### 1. About project

I used libraries in the project: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib

Models will be compared: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost.

### 2. A few charts from the project

### 4. Summary of the analysis

Model comparison. In my opinion, it is very important to correctly interpret the task results.

The random forest and XGB models performed best in predicting the price of a car.
